# Implementation Plan — Hexagonal Architecture Conformance & Dependency Policy

**Mode:** [PLAN] · **Status:** Ready · **Date:** 2026-06-07
**Supersedes:** the earlier "Domain Layer Purity" draft (its `_registry_accessor` service-locator decision is **rejected** — see §3).
**Execution ledger:** `TASKS-architecture-conformance.md` — work units, status, and the per-session resume protocol live there. This PLAN is the *what/why*; the TASKS file is the *how-to-execute-across-sessions*.

---

## 1. Context and Motivation

A soundness review found that the project's stated hexagonal architecture is sound in *direction* but not yet *consistently enforced*. A second review deepened the findings: the original quick-fix plan (relocate `DiagramTypeBase`, rename `diagram_types.py`, fix README, add a domain-only grep) addressed real problems but **understated** the systemic issues and proposed a solution (a global registry accessor relocated into `domain/`) that would remove an *import* violation while preserving the underlying *dependency* — a service locator with hidden dependencies, global mutable state, init-order coupling, and cross-test contamination.

This plan replaces that approach with **explicit dependency injection from composition roots**, a **complete and enforced dependency policy** across all six packages, and a **frozen runtime catalog** built once at startup. It folds the original quick wins into their correct architectural position and addresses the full set of concerns.

**Scope boundary (locked):** No change may alter the **REST API**, **MCP tool surface**, or **CLI command surface**. These are the system's published contracts. Internal API changes — constructors, ports, module layout, injection wiring — are explicitly in scope, and larger cleanups are sanctioned where they stay behind those three surfaces.

---

## 2. Concern → Phase Traceability

| # | Concern (from review) | Phase(s) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No service locator in domain; inject focused catalogs from composition root | **B, C** |
| 2 | Define & enforce the complete dependency policy (all 6 packages, incl. lazy imports) | **A** |
| 3 | `ModuleRegistry` as aggregate with frozen runtime state; split builder/catalog; kill import-time snapshots; same for derivation registry | **B** |
| 4 | Split oversized `ArtifactStorePort` and verifier responsibilities | **F, G** |
| 5 | Refine the `DiagramTypeBase` move; classify `diagram_types` as a plugin/adapter package | **D, E** |
| 6 | Strengthen real immutability; publish immutable views; pure rule cores | **H** (+ B, G) |
| 7 | Clarify domain language; glossary; incremental (not cosmetic) renames | **I** (+ E) |
| 8 | Synchronize the self-model & README as architectural deliverables | **J** |
| 9 | Plugin self-registration anti-pattern; lazy fallback imports; SVG converter coupling; zero-baseline DoD | **K** |

Phases are ordered by dependency. **A → B → C** are the foundation and must land in order. **D, E** are small and can land alongside C. **F, G, H** are larger structural refactors that depend on C and may be staged/scheduled independently. **I, J** are finishing work that must reflect whatever the earlier phases actually changed.

---

## 3. Approach Decision — Dependency Inversion Style

Three options were on the table for breaking the `domain → infrastructure` registry dependency:

1. **Pass `ModuleRegistry` to every function (functional/reader threading).** Rejected as the *sole* mechanism: ~40 catalog functions across 3 modules rely on `@lru_cache`, which breaks under per-call parameters; threading a never-changing singleton through 16 call sites and infrastructure constructors adds verbosity without inversion benefit.
2. **A global accessor relocated to `domain/_registry_accessor.py`** (the earlier draft's choice). **Rejected.** Moving the singleton into `domain/` removes the *import* arrow but keeps the *dependency*: hidden coupling, global mutable state, initialization-order fragility, cross-test contamination, inability to host two configured registries in one process, and caches that outlive registry replacement. A service locator in the domain violates dependency inversion and GRASP low-coupling regardless of which package the file sits in.
3. **Focused, injectable catalog objects built at the composition root.** **Chosen.**

### Chosen design (concern #1)

Define narrow **domain Protocols** describing registry *semantics*, with **immutable implementations** backed by a frozen `ModuleCatalog`:

- `OntologyCatalog` — entity/connection type lookups, element classes, domain ordering, prefixes, stereotype maps (absorbs today's `src/domain/ontology_catalog.py` free functions).
- `ConnectionSemantics` — permitted relationships, symmetry, classification, permissibility (absorbs `src/domain/connection_ontology.py`).
- `DiagramTypeCatalog` — diagram-type lookup, domain inference, relation-label suppression tokens (absorbs `src/infrastructure/diagram_types.py` and the registry-using parts of `src/domain/archimate_relation_rendering.py`).

These three are bundled into a frozen **`RuntimeCatalogs`** value (in `application/`) and **injected**:

- **FastAPI**: keep the existing app-state installation (`src/infrastructure/app_bootstrap.py:62` `install_module_registry`); extend it to install `RuntimeCatalogs`; expose via a `Depends(...)` dependency. Routers receive catalogs as parameters, not via module-level imports.
- **MCP**: the stdio bridges connect to the same unified backend over HTTP, so MCP tool logic resolves catalogs from the shared backend context object (`src/infrastructure/mcp/artifact_mcp/context.py`), not from a global.
- **CLI**: `src/infrastructure/cli/artifact_query_cli.py` and the assurance CLI construct the catalogs explicitly at `main()` and pass them down.

Derived values are cached **inside each catalog instance** (e.g. `functools.cached_property` or a frozen pre-computed map), not in module-level `@lru_cache`. Replacing the catalog replaces its caches atomically; tests construct a catalog from a fake/minimal `ModuleCatalog` with zero global state.

**Net effect:** `src/domain/` ends with **no** import — eager or lazy — of `src/infrastructure/` or `src/config/`. The catalog free-function modules either become the homes of the immutable implementations (pure, domain-only) or are deleted in favour of methods.

---

## 4. Locked Decisions

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | **No global service locator** anywhere (domain, application, or infrastructure module scope). Runtime configuration flows by constructor/parameter injection from the three composition roots. |
| D2 | Split `ModuleRegistry` into a mutable **`ModuleCatalogBuilder`** (`register_*`, `replace_*`, `unregister_*`) and an immutable **`ModuleCatalog`** (all query methods). `build()`/`freeze()` produces the catalog; the builder rejects further registration after build. Naming follows the *product*: it catalogs **modules**, so `ModuleCatalog` + `ModuleCatalogBuilder` (not "Model…"). |
| D3 | Focused catalog **Protocols** (`OntologyCatalog`, `ConnectionSemantics`, `DiagramTypeCatalog`) live in `src/domain/`; their immutable implementations live in `src/domain/` (pure, backed by `ModuleCatalog`); the `RuntimeCatalogs` bundle lives in `src/application/`. |
| D4 | Remove import-time snapshots `ENTITY_TYPES` / `CONNECTION_TYPES` (`src/application/verification/artifact_verifier_types.py:94`). Validation contexts derive their valid-type sets from the injected catalog at verification time. |
| D5 | Apply the same freeze/build lifecycle to the global derivation registry (`src/application/derivation/strategy_registry.py:27`): a builder populated at startup, an immutable lookup injected into verifier rule E412 and the refresh dispatcher. |
| D6 | Author an explicit **dependency matrix** (§5) and enforce it with an **AST-based architecture test** covering all six packages and **lazy/in-function imports**. The test ships in a baseline mode that records current violations and fails on *new* ones, then violations are burned down phase by phase until the baseline is empty. |
| D7 | `domain → config` (`src/domain/artifact_types.py:5` → `infer_repo_scope`) is removed: the pure path-classification helper moves into `domain/`; YAML/workspace-file reading stays in `config/`. |
| D8 | `domain → ontologies` (`src/domain/ontology_catalog.py:9` → `matrix_abbreviations`) is removed: the ArchiMate matrix-abbreviation data is supplied through the injected `OntologyCatalog`, not imported from a concrete ontology package. |
| D9 | `DiagramTypeBase` relocates to `src/diagram_types/_base.py` **and** `src/diagram_types/` is **formally classified as a plugin/adapter package** (may depend on infrastructure renderers). Stage 2 (split declarative descriptor from renderer adapter, inject a renderer factory at bootstrap) is a flagged follow-on, not required for this plan's DoD. |
| D10 | `src/infrastructure/diagram_types.py` → `src/infrastructure/diagram_type_registry.py` (its lookup logic is largely absorbed by `DiagramTypeCatalog`; any residue is an infrastructure adapter). |
| D11 | `ArtifactStorePort` is segregated into role-focused contracts (§Phase F). The concrete store implements all of them; each consumer depends only on the narrow contract it uses. |
| D12 | Verifier is refactored toward **pure rule functions over parsed inputs**, with filesystem loading, PlantUML/Java execution, worker pools, and incremental-state persistence behind **application-owned ports** with infrastructure adapters (§Phase G). May be staged. |
| D13 | Public contract return types use immutable views (`Mapping`, `tuple`, `frozenset`); mutable builders stay local to parsing/indexing/validation; config is copied+frozen when published into a catalog (§Phase H). |
| D14 | Renames are **responsibility-driven, not cosmetic** — applied only to modules whose boundaries this work changes. A glossary (§Phase I) records the canonical vocabulary. |
| D15 | The self-model and README are updated **in the same change set** as the code that invalidates them; a verifier check flags self-model `Module:` properties that point at non-existent source paths (§Phase J). |
| D16 | **All strategy registrations are performed at the composition root** (`app_bootstrap.py`), never as module-level side effects. Strategy modules in `diagram_types/` expose a `MANIFEST` constant (domain type); pure application-layer strategies (`explicit-selection`, `local-neighborhood`, etc.) are registered explicitly in `app_bootstrap.py`. The global mutable `_registry`/`_derive_fns` dicts in `strategy_registry.py` are deleted; `DerivationStrategyCatalogBuilder` is used directly in `app_bootstrap.py`; runtime consumers use the injected `DerivationStrategyCatalog`. The orphaned `RuntimeCatalogs.derivation` snapshot is thereby activated — it is now the authoritative source. |
| D17 | **`DiagramTypeModuleManifest`** (in `domain/module_manifest.py`) declares `compatible_ontologies: tuple[str, ...]` — a statement of which base ontologies the diagram type can operate over, not a hard requirement of all of them. `ontology_role_mapping: Mapping[str, Mapping[str, tuple[str, ...]]]` maps each ontology id → (visual role → model entity type names). Roles intentionally absent from the mapping have no model counterpart and are rendered as pure diagram-notation nodes (e.g. C4 grouping boxes). The composition root selects the active ontology and configures the projection accordingly. Full parameterisation of projection algorithms to use the active mapping rather than hard-coded ArchiMate NEXT type constants is a flagged follow-on (K2-followon). |
| D18 | **`scope_projection.py` and the module-projection registry are dead code** and are deleted. The generic `scope-projection/v1` meta-dispatcher (which reads `projection_id` from params and routes to a secondary registry) has no production consumer: all C4 diagrams set `strategy: c4.scope-projection` directly. No abstraction is lost. |

## 5. Dependency Matrix (the policy — concern #2)

```
package          may import from
──────────────   ────────────────────────────────────────────────
domain        →  domain only
application   →  domain, application
ontologies/*  →  domain (contracts + types) only            [plugin]
diagram_types/* → domain (contracts + types), infrastructure renderers   [adapter/plugin — see D9]
config        →  config, domain (value types only)          [leaf]
infrastructure → application, domain, plugins, config
composition   →  all packages   (app_bootstrap, cli/main, mcp server modules)
```

Notes:
- **`config` is a leaf**: it may use domain value types but nothing else; domain must not import config (D7).
- **`ontologies/*` are pure plugins**: domain contracts only — no infrastructure, no application.
- **`diagram_types/*` are adapter-plugins** (D9): explicitly permitted to touch infrastructure renderers, distinguishing them from pure ontology plugins.
- **"composition"** is not a package but a role: the entry-point modules that wire everything (`app_bootstrap`, CLI `main()`s, MCP server bootstrap). They alone may import across all layers.

## 6. Phases & Checklist

### Phase A — Dependency policy & architecture test (foundation)

- [x] **A1** Write the dependency matrix (§5) into a short architecture doc (`docs/architecture/dependency-policy.md` or a `## Architecture` section in README — TBD with R6/J).
- [x] **A2** Implement an AST-based architecture test `tests/architecture/test_dependency_policy.py`:
  - Walk every `*.py` under `src/`, parse with `ast`, collect **all** `Import`/`ImportFrom` nodes **including those nested inside functions** (lazy imports).
  - Classify each module into a package role; assert its imports obey the matrix.
  - Run in **baseline mode**: a checked-in `architecture_baseline.json` enumerates current known violations; the test fails only on violations **not** in the baseline.
- [x] **A3** Seed the baseline from the current tree (so CI is green at the start), then remove entries as each phase eliminates them. **DoD for the whole plan includes an empty baseline.**
- [x] **A4** Quality gates green (pytest, ruff, zuban).

### Phase B — Immutable `ModuleCatalog` + focused catalogs (concerns #1, #3)

- [x] **B1** Add `ModuleCatalogBuilder` (mutable; current `register_*`/`replace_*`/`unregister_*`) and immutable `ModuleCatalog` (all query methods) in `src/domain/module_catalog.py`. Builder `.build()` returns a `ModuleCatalog` and refuses subsequent registration. Keep `ModuleRegistry` temporarily as a thin alias only if needed to stage callers; remove by end of C.
- [x] **B2** Define Protocols `OntologyCatalog`, `ConnectionSemantics`, `DiagramTypeCatalog` in `src/domain/` and immutable implementations backed by a `ModuleCatalog`, caching derived values per-instance (`cached_property`/precomputed frozen maps). Port the logic currently in `ontology_catalog.py`, `connection_ontology.py`, and the registry-using parts of `archimate_relation_rendering.py`.
- [x] **B3** Remove import-time snapshots `ENTITY_TYPES`/`CONNECTION_TYPES` (`artifact_verifier_types.py:94`); the verifier derives these from the injected catalog (lands fully in C when the verifier receives the catalog).
- [x] **B4** Split the derivation registry (`strategy_registry.py`) into a `DerivationStrategyCatalogBuilder` + immutable `DerivationStrategyCatalog`; remove module-level `_registry`/`_derive_fns` globals.
- [x] **B5** Unit tests: build a `ModuleCatalog` from a minimal fake; assert builder rejects post-build registration; assert catalogs expose immutable views.
- [x] **B6** Quality gates green.

### Phase C — Composition-root injection (concern #1)

- [x] **C1** Add `RuntimeCatalogs` (frozen dataclass) in `src/application/runtime_catalogs.py` bundling the three catalogs (+ `DerivationStrategyCatalog`).
- [x] **C2** `app_bootstrap.py`: build `ModuleCatalog` via the builder, construct `RuntimeCatalogs`, install on FastAPI app-state (extend existing `install_module_registry` at line 62 → `install_runtime_catalogs`). Add a `Depends` provider `runtime_catalogs_dependency(request)`.
- [x] **C3** Migrate FastAPI routers and application/infrastructure consumers off the deleted free-function modules onto injected catalogs (constructor params or `Depends`). Enumerated call sites (16) from the dependency audit:
  - `application/artifact_parsing.py`, `application/modeling/artifact_write.py`, `application/modeling/matrix_builder.py`, `application/verification/artifact_verifier.py` (+`_verifier_rules_semantic.py`, `artifact_verifier_types.py`)
  - `infrastructure/artifact_index/_sqlite_store.py`, `infrastructure/gui/routers/connections.py`, `infrastructure/rendering/{archimate_puml_renderer,diagram_builder,generate_static_includes,generic_puml_renderer}.py`, `infrastructure/write/artifact_write/{connection,diagram_references,type_guidance}.py`
- [x] **C4** CLI composition roots (`cli/artifact_query_cli.py`, `cli/arch_assurance.py`) construct catalogs in `main()` and pass down.
- [x] **C5** MCP: resolve catalogs from the shared backend context (`mcp/artifact_mcp/context.py`); no module-global lookups in tool logic.
- [x] **C6** Delete `src/domain/ontology_catalog.py`, `src/domain/connection_ontology.py` free-function APIs and the registry-coupled parts of `archimate_relation_rendering.py`; remove `get_module_registry` global from `app_bootstrap.py` (or reduce to a composition-root-only builder helper). **No `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` registry singletons remain.**
- [x] **C7** Architecture-test baseline: remove all `domain → infrastructure` entries; they must now pass.
- [x] **C8** Quality gates green; full regression run.

### Phase D — `config` / `ontologies` dependency cleanup (concerns #2, #5)

- [x] **D1** Move the pure repo-scope/path-classification helper out of `config.workspace_paths` into `domain/` (e.g. `domain/repo_scope.py`); leave YAML/workspace-file reading in `config/`. Update `domain/artifact_types.py:5`.
- [x] **D2** Remove `domain/ontology_catalog.py`'s import of `src.ontologies.archimate_next.matrix_abbreviations` — supply matrix abbreviations through `OntologyCatalog` (sourced from the ontology modules at build time).
- [x] **D3** Architecture-test: classify `ontologies/*` (pure plugin) and `diagram_types/*` (adapter-plugin, D9); remove the corresponding baseline entries.
- [x] **D4** Quality gates green.

### Phase E — `DiagramTypeBase` relocation + registry rename (concern #5)

- [x] **E1** Create `src/diagram_types/_base.py`; move `DiagramTypeBase` from `ontology_protocol.py` (keep its `GenericPumlRenderer` import — `diagram_types` is now a classified adapter package). Remove `DiagramTypeBase` from `ontology_protocol.__all__`; only Protocols/types remain there.
- [x] **E2** Update the 8 diagram-type module imports + `tests/domain/test_bridges.py`.
- [x] **E3** Rename `src/infrastructure/diagram_types.py` → `diagram_type_registry.py`; update the 12 import sites; fold its lookup logic into `DiagramTypeCatalog` where it duplicates B2, leaving only genuine infra adapter code.
- [x] **E4** Regression test asserting `src.domain.ontology_protocol` imports cleanly with **no** `src.infrastructure` import on any path.
- [ ] **E5** (Flagged follow-on, not in DoD) Stage 2: split declarative diagram descriptor from renderer adapter; inject a renderer factory at bootstrap.
- [x] **E6** Quality gates green.

### Phase F — Interface segregation of `ArtifactStorePort` (concern #4)

- [x] **F1** Split the ~40-method `ArtifactStorePort` (`application/ports.py:18`) into role contracts: `ArtifactLookup`, `ArtifactSearch`, `RelationshipGraph`, `RepositoryScopeResolver`, `ArtifactIndexLifecycle`, `ArtifactMutationObserver`.
- [x] **F2** The concrete index/store implements all; each consumer's type hints narrow to the contract(s) it actually uses.
- [x] **F3** Update `ArtifactRepository` and consumers to depend on the narrow contracts.
- [x] **F4** Quality gates green. (Independent of G; runs as its own work unit WU-09 — in DoD.)

### Phase G — Verifier pipeline refactor (concerns #4, #6)

- [x] **G1** Extract pure rule functions operating on already-parsed inputs (frontmatter dicts, parsed PUML, catalog) returning `Issue` lists; orchestration composes them.
- [x] **G2** Define application-owned ports for: filesystem inventory/loading, PlantUML/Java syntax execution, worker-pool scheduling, incremental-state persistence; move existing infra code behind adapters.
- [x] **G3** Reduce `artifact_verifier.py` (822 lines) and `artifact_verifier_rules.py` (542 lines) below the policy hard limit where feasible; update `source_file_length.py` baselines downward as files shrink.
- [ ] **G4** Quality gates green. (Largest phase; split across dedicated work units WU-10..WU-12, executed after A–E land — **in DoD**.)

### Phase H — Immutability hardening (concern #6)

- [x] **H1** Audit `@dataclass(frozen=True)` records carrying mutable `dict`/`list` (e.g. `EntityRecord.extra`, `display_blocks`); publish immutable views (`Mapping`, `tuple`, `frozenset`) across architectural boundaries; keep mutable builders local.
- [x] **H2** Copy+freeze configuration when publishing it into a catalog.
- [ ] **H3** Ensure verification accumulates issues via returned values from pure functions rather than mutating shared result objects (overlaps G).
- [x] **H4** Quality gates green.

### Phase I — Glossary & responsibility-driven renames (concern #7)

- [ ] **I1** Add a glossary (architecture doc / README §) distinguishing: ontology-&-diagram **Module Catalog**; **Artifact Index**; **Artifact Repository**; **Application Composition Root**; **Runtime Host**; **Verification Policy** vs **Verification Executor**.
- [ ] **I2** Rename only modules whose responsibilities changed in A–H (e.g. confirm `ModuleCatalog` vs self-model "Model Registry"; `diagram_type_registry`); avoid cosmetic churn elsewhere.
- [ ] **I3** Quality gates green.

### Phase J — Self-model & README sync (concern #8)

- [ ] **J1** Update self-model entities `APP@…yNhgdh` (**Model Registry**) and `APP@…ca3vm7` (**Model Verifier**) via MCP tools: their `Module:` properties cite `src/common/model_verifier_registry.py` / `src/common/model_verifier.py`, which **no longer exist**. Either remove implementation paths from these conceptual components or replace with accurate role-oriented descriptions + traceability properties pointing at real modules. Reconcile "Model Registry" naming with `ModuleCatalog` (D14/I2).
- [ ] **J2** Fix README `Repository Layout` to the real six-package structure (`domain/ application/ infrastructure/ config/ diagram_types/ ontologies/`) and correct the `Repository Layout` prose; also correct stale module-doc headers (e.g. `mcp_artifact_server.py` docstring referencing `src/common/` and `src/tools/`).
- [ ] **J3** Add a verifier check that flags self-model `Module:` source-path properties pointing at non-existent files (conformance guard).
- [ ] **J4** Quality gates green.

### Phase K — Plugin registration inversion + baseline clearance (concern #9)

Resolves the 9 remaining entries in `architecture_baseline.json` through four sequenced moves: dead-code removal, registration inversion via module manifests, an SVG converter port, and completing the injection migration. Together these bring the baseline to **zero** and satisfy the final DoD bullet.

- [x] **K1** Delete `src/application/derivation/scope_projection.py` in its entirety (the generic meta-dispatcher and its module-projection registry are dead code — D18). Remove the `register_module_projection("c4", 1, _derive)` call from `src/diagram_types/c4/_projection.py`. Delete `tests/application/derivation/test_scope_projection.py` (it covers only the dead path). No baseline entry resolved directly, but eliminates the code that K2 would otherwise have to maintain.

- [x] **K2** Invert all strategy registrations to the composition root (D16, D17). Steps: (a) Move `StrategySpec` to `src/domain/derivation_types.py` alongside `CandidateSet`, `ModelQuery`, `DeriveFn`. (b) Define `DiagramTypeModuleManifest` in `src/domain/module_manifest.py` as a frozen dataclass with `id`, `version`, `compatible_ontologies: tuple[str, ...]`, `ontology_role_mapping: Mapping[str, Mapping[str, tuple[str, ...]]]` (visual-role → model entity types per ontology; absent roles are intentionally unmodelled), `strategies: tuple[tuple[StrategySpec, DeriveFn], ...]`. (c) C4's `_projection.py` exposes a `MANIFEST` constant and removes its `register_strategy()` call; no other application imports remain. (d) All pure-application strategy modules (`explicit_selection`, `local_neighborhood`, `incident_connections`, `path_projection`) also remove their module-level `register_strategy()` side effects. (e) `app_bootstrap.py` registers all strategies explicitly and builds `DerivationStrategyCatalog` via `DerivationStrategyCatalogBuilder` — delete `snapshot_catalog()` and the module-level mutable `_registry`/`_derive_fns` globals from `strategy_registry.py`. (f) Route runtime consumers (`refresh.py`, `_verifier_rules_view_derivations.py`) to the injected `catalogs.derivation`. Resolves `diagram_types/c4 → application.derivation.strategy_registry` and `→ application.derivation.scope_projection` (2 baseline entries). **Flagged follow-on (K2-followon, out of DoD):** parameterise `project_c4()` to use the active ontology's entity type set from `ontology_role_mapping` rather than hardcoded ArchiMate NEXT constants; this unlocks the SysML v2 compatibility path declared by the manifest.

- [ ] **K3** Decouple `ontologies/archimate_next/_loader.py` from `src/infrastructure/rendering/_svg_sprite_convert.py`. The loader function that calls `browser_markup_to_plantuml_svg` lazily is refactored to accept a `svg_converter: Callable[[str], str]` parameter; `app_bootstrap.py` passes `browser_markup_to_plantuml_svg` from `infrastructure/` when building the `OntologyCatalog`. No Protocol wrapper needed — a typed callable suffices. Resolves `ontologies/archimate_next → infrastructure.rendering._svg_sprite_convert` (1 baseline entry).

- [ ] **K4** Remove all lazy `src.infrastructure.app_bootstrap` fallbacks from the application layer. Affected: `artifact_parsing.py`, `entity_type_predicates.py`, `modeling/artifact_write.py`, `modeling/matrix_builder.py`, `verification/artifact_verifier.py` (catalog default + adapter defaults). Audit every call site; thread `RuntimeCatalogs` explicitly wherever needed; tests construct `RuntimeCatalogs` from a minimal `ModuleCatalog` (test infrastructure already exists from WU-03). After this pass `architecture_baseline.json` must be **empty** — confirmed by the arch test running cleanly with no baseline file or an explicitly empty `[]`. Resolves all remaining 6 `application → infrastructure.*` entries.

- [ ] **K5** Quality gates green and `architecture_baseline.json` confirmed empty.

## 8. Definition of Done

- [ ] **No service locator / global registry singleton** remains (no `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` registry accessors; no module-level mutable registries).
- [ ] `src/domain/` imports **only** `src/domain/` — verified by the AST architecture test, lazy imports included.
- [ ] The dependency matrix (§5) holds for **all six packages**; `architecture_baseline.json` is **empty**.
- [ ] `ModuleCatalogBuilder` + immutable `ModuleCatalog` exist; the builder rejects post-build registration; import-time `ENTITY_TYPES`/`CONNECTION_TYPES` snapshots are gone; the derivation registry has the same lifecycle.
- [ ] `RuntimeCatalogs` is built at all three composition roots (FastAPI app-state, CLI `main()`, MCP backend context) and injected; no consumer reaches a global.
- [ ] `DiagramTypeBase` lives in `src/diagram_types/_base.py`; `ontology_protocol.py` exports only Protocols/types; `infrastructure/diagram_type_registry.py` replaces `diagram_types.py`.
- [ ] `ArtifactStorePort` is segregated into role contracts; consumers depend on narrow ones. *(Phase F)*
- [ ] Verifier is a pipeline of pure rules over parsed inputs with I/O behind application-owned ports. *(Phase G)*
- [x] Public contracts expose immutable views; configuration is frozen on publication. *(Phase H)*
- [ ] Glossary published; renames are responsibility-driven only. *(Phase I)*
- [ ] Self-model (`Model Registry`, `Model Verifier`) and README reflect the real implementation; a verifier conformance check guards self-model source paths. *(Phase J)*
- [x] All strategy registrations are at the composition root; no module-level side effects; `DerivationStrategyCatalog` built directly from manifests and injected. *(Phase K)*
- [x] `DiagramTypeModuleManifest` in `domain/` declares ontology compatibility and role-to-entity-type mapping; `scope_projection.py` deleted. *(Phase K)*
- [ ] `architecture_baseline.json` is **empty** — arch test passes with zero violations. *(Phase K)*
- [ ] **No change to REST, MCP, or CLI surfaces.**

---

## 9. Sequencing & Feasibility Notes

- **Land first (low risk, high leverage):** A → B → C, with D and E folded in. This eliminates the entire `domain → infrastructure/config/ontologies` class of violations and removes all global state — the core of concerns #1–#3 and #5.
- **Larger, lower coupling — still in DoD:** **Phase F** (port segregation) and **Phase G** (verifier pipeline) are sizable and touch hot paths. They are **not** deferred out of scope; they run as their own work units (WU-09 for F; WU-10–12 for G) in later sessions once the foundation is in place. Their session boundaries are organisational, not scope boundaries.
- **Always last:** **I** and **J** must reflect the final shape of the code; doing them earlier risks re-drift. **WU-14 (I/glossary) now depends on WU-20/K4** so the glossary can name the final manifest/catalog vocabulary.
- **Phase K** runs alongside **H** (WU-17 is immediate dead-code removal, independent; WU-18/19 depend only on K1; WU-20 depends on WU-18+19). K clears the baseline; H hardens the value types; neither blocks the other.
- **Open follow-on (out of DoD):** E5 (diagram descriptor/renderer split); K2-followon (parameterise `project_c4()` for non-ArchiMate NEXT ontologies via `ontology_role_mapping`); "every modification yields a new registry value" (vs freeze-after-build).
