# GRC Management Skill

GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) is the lifecycle manager for assurance-constraints:
it governs (accountability), evaluates (risk), treats, and evidences (compliance).

GRC builds on the STPA/CAST analysis — constraints from those analyses flow into GRC.
All work goes through `assurance_*` MCP tools on the `arch-assurance-read` and
`arch-assurance-write` servers. Never edit the SQLCipher store directly.

## The GRC Loop

```
Hazard/Loss-Scenario → Risk (evaluate) → Treatment → Assurance-Constraint → Obligation (comply)
                                                            ↓
                                                    Evidence → Sign-off
```

### Step 1 — Evaluate Risk

Risk is **optional** — constraints are valid without a risk entity (§9 anti-subordination safeguard).
Create a risk entity to prioritise and track treatment.

```
assurance_create_node(node_type="risk", name="RSK-1: <brief description>",
                      attributes={"likelihood": "medium", "impact": "high",
                                  "risk_score": "high", "treatment": "mitigate",
                                  "review_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"})
assurance_add_edge(source_id=risk_id, target_id=hazard_id, conn_type="assesses")
assurance_add_edge(source_id=risk_id, target_id=constraint_id, conn_type="treated-by")
```

> **Safety/security constraints cannot be "closed" by a risk accept** — E504 blocks this.
> treatment=accept is only valid for non-safety concern_class.

Assign an owner to every risk:
```
assurance_add_edge(source_id=risk_id, target_id=role_node_id, conn_type="accountable-to")
```

### Step 2 — Define Compliance Obligations

An obligation represents "does our system comply with clause X of standard Y?"
Status and evidence are assurance-owned and confidential.

```
assurance_create_node(node_type="obligation",
                      name="OBL-1: ISO 26262:6-8 compliance",
                      attributes={"scheme": "ISO26262", "code": "6-8",
                                  "status": "in-progress"})
```

Link obligations to constraints (the constraint is what satisfies the obligation):
```
assurance_add_edge(source_id=constraint_id, target_id=obligation_id,
                   conn_type="complies-with")
```

W504 fires for obligations with no complies-with constraint — run `assurance_verify`.

### Step 3 — Add Evidence Links

Link constraints to their evidence artifacts (documents, test results, audit records):
```
assurance_add_edge(source_id=constraint_id, target_id=evidence_arch_id,
                   conn_type="evidenced-by")
```

> For architecture artifacts as evidence: use `assurance_register_arch_ref` for the
> one-way assurance→architecture reference, then reference the arch_id in the evidenced-by edge.

### Step 4 — Coverage and Gaps

Use the coverage tools to find what's incomplete:

```
assurance_grc_complete()     # §17(B) profile: obligations covered? risks treated?
assurance_coverage()         # Full gap dashboard across all concern types
assurance_risk_register()    # Tabular view of all risks
assurance_verify()           # §17(A) hard validity (E502–E505) + warnings (W502–W505)
```

### Step 5 — Promotion Preflight

Before promoting findings to a wider audience or enterprise tier:
```
assurance_promotion_preflight()   # Checks all safety/security constraints have owner + evidence
```

## Document Types

- **risk-assessment**: structured risk analysis with ISO 31000 sections
- **risk-treatment-plan**: approved treatments, implementation plan, residual risk, sign-off
- **compliance-statement**: obligation coverage, evidence summary, gaps, sign-off

Create these via the `artifact_create_document` tool on `arch-repo-write`.

---

## Gotchas

- **Safety/security constraints need owners** — E502 fires without an accountable-to connection.
- **risk.treatment=accept is blocked for safety hazards** — E504 enforces the §2.1 safeguard.
- **W505 fires for risks without a treatment attribute** — always set treatment.
- **W504 fires for obligations with no complies-with** — link at least one constraint.
- **GRC is optional** — STPA/CAST constraints are valid and enforced with no risk entity.
  Risk *prioritises* treatment, it never closes a safety constraint.
- **Ask, don't assume TLP** — before setting TLP:AMBER or TLP:RED, confirm the sensitivity.
  Promotion of classified findings requires sign-off (§23 promotion gate).
