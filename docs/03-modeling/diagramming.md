# Diagramming

Diagrams are views over the model. A **diagram type module** declares which entity and
connection types a view accepts and how it renders. Most ArchiMate views are config-only and
share the `GenericPumlRenderer`; families with their own notation (activity, sequence,
matrix, C4) bring a custom renderer. The full extension contract lives in
[`src/diagram_types/README.md`](../../src/diagram_types/README.md) and is summarised for
authors in [Diagram-type modules](../05-extensibility/diagram-type-modules.md).

Two kinds of content can appear in a view:

- **Model entities** — real entities from the store, referenced by `entity_id`. Editing the
  diagram never mutates them.
- **Diagram-only entities** — types that live only inside a diagram's `diagram-entities:`
  frontmatter (swimlanes, sequence participants, C4 boundaries). They are never written to
  the model store.

## ArchiMate views

One view per domain — **motivation, strategy, business, application, technology,
implementation** — plus a **layered** view that spans all domains. These are config-backed:
each `config.yaml` sets the domain filter, grouping, and layout hints, and the shared
ArchiMate renderer handles stereotypes, glyphs, nesting, and flow arrows. Connection
descriptions stay hidden unless a diagram explicitly opts in per connection.

&nbsp;

## Matrix

A free-ontology view that accepts every entity type and renders as a Markdown table rather
than PlantUML. Use it for relationship matrices — for example, requirements against the
components that realise them, or stakeholders against concerns. Authored and edited through
the dedicated matrix create/edit flow.

&nbsp;

## Activity (UML)

A UML activity view with **swimlanes** as diagram-only entities. Actions are placed in lanes,
lanes map to model roles or actors, and notes attach to steps. Structural relationships
(step-in-lane, note-of) are stored in the diagram's `connections:` list, not as properties,
and the custom renderer builds the swimlane layout from them.

&nbsp;

## Sequence (UML)

A UML sequence view with participants and ordered messages, linked by stable local ids. The
GUI provides a bespoke editor (wired through the diagram type's `type_ui_slots`) for adding
participants and messages without hand-editing frontmatter.

&nbsp;

## Datatype (UML class)

A restricted UML class diagram for modelling data structures and their relationships. The
diagram owns five **diagram-only connection types** (`dt-association`, `dt-aggregation`,
`dt-composition`, `dt-generalization`, `dt-dependency`) and five **classifier kinds**
(`class`, `datatype`, `enumeration`, `variant`, `primitive`).

Each classifier may be **bound** to a Data Object entity in the model store, recording that
the diagram's structural depiction corresponds to a specific model element. When both ends of
a `dt-*` edge are bound, the system enforces **§3.2 consistency**: the edge must have a
**backing model connection** whose `relationship_kind` matches the `dt-*` type:

| dt-* type | Relationship kind | Compatible backing types (examples) |
|---|---|---|
| `dt-association` | association | `archimate-association` |
| `dt-aggregation` | containment | `archimate-aggregation` |
| `dt-composition` | containment | `archimate-composition` |
| `dt-generalization` | generalization | `archimate-specialization` |
| `dt-dependency` | dependency | `archimate-association` |

Two error codes enforce this invariant:

- **E330** (forward) — a `dt-*` edge between two bound classifiers has no backing connection.
  The GUI editor shows an inline "Create & bind" quick-fix: clicking it creates the preferred
  backing connection between the two Data Objects and records the binding automatically.
- **E331** (reverse) — a recorded backing connection has the wrong `relationship_kind` or
  points the wrong direction.

Both errors surface through the standard verification flow (inline in the GUI, structured
`details` and `actions` fields in the MCP/REST response) and clear as soon as a correct
binding is in place.

Authoring via MCP: pass `diagram-type: datatype` to `artifact_create_diagram` or
`artifact_edit_diagram`. Use `artifact_authoring_guidance(filter=["classifier"])` to see the
accepted vocabulary. The legacy `er-*` connection types are deprecated; new diagrams should
use the `dt-*` family.

&nbsp;

## C4

A progressive zoom across three levels — **system context** (L1), **container** (L2), and
**component** (L3). C4 views are **model-backed**: a projection engine derives view content
from the ArchiMate graph (a software system, its containers, its components), so the diagram
stays consistent with the model. Parent/child navigation moves between levels, and a
preview/refresh path shows what a projection will include before it is saved.

Node descriptions are **off by default** — C4 nodes render name only. Set
`show_node_descriptions: true` in the diagram's frontmatter to include the description line
under the name.

C4 containers and components support a **shape** property that maps to C4 PlantUML macros:

| Shape value | Rendered as | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| *(empty / default)* | `Container` / `Component` | Generic box |
| `Container/ComponentDb` | `ContainerDb` / `ComponentDb` | Databases, file stores |
| `Container/ComponentQueue` | `ContainerQueue` / `ComponentQueue` | Message queues, event buses |

The `shape` field is a dropdown in the create view. Setting `external: true` on any entity
appends the `_Ext` suffix automatically (`ContainerDb_Ext`, etc.).

&nbsp;

**Edit view sidebar.** Opening an existing model-backed C4 diagram in the edit view populates
the sidebar with the **derived entities** (grouped by role: software systems, containers,
components, actors) and the **read-only connections** between them. Entities in the sidebar
are those the projection found in the model — adding or removing them in the model updates
what appears on a refresh.

&nbsp;

## Viewer interactivity

The rendered SVG viewer is interactive for C4 diagrams and any architecture-repository GSN
diagram:

- **Click a node** — the detail sidebar opens with the entity name, type badges, description,
  and connections. C4 nodes are identified by `data-entity-id` attributes attached when the
  SVG is rendered.
- **Click an edge** — the connection flow detail opens, showing the relationship kind and both
  endpoint names.
- Clicking a second element deselects the first; clicking the same element toggles it off.

Assurance diagrams (bowtie, control structure, UCA matrix) have the same selection UX inside
their own assurance viewer — see [Assurance diagrams](../04-assurance/diagrams.md).

&nbsp;

## Authoring a diagram

The GUI authoring flow is the same shape across families:

1. **Pick entities** through a search filter scoped to the view's accepted types.
2. **Expand related entities** — pull in neighbours of what you have already placed.
3. **Manage connections** side by side with the entity list.
4. **Preview the PlantUML live**, then render to SVG.

Rendered SVGs are interactive: click an entity to open it, and follow its relationships
visually.

Agents get the same capability through the MCP write tools, plus two helpers:

- **`artifact_diagram_scaffold`** — produce a starting diagram skeleton for a chosen type.
- **`artifact_authoring_guidance`** — return each diagram type's `when_to_use` /
  `when_not_to_use` guidance and accepted vocabulary, so an agent picks the right view before
  authoring.
