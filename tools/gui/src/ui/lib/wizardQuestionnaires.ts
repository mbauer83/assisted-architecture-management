/**
 * Content-driven questionnaire/spine step definitions (WU-B2c, uplifted per WU-B4). Wording
 * lives here, not in a component template, so it iterates without code churn.
 *
 * The flow is **omnidirectional** (decision D-7): there is no planning/reverse mode. The spine
 * (motivation ↔ business ↔ common ↔ application) is a map, not a rail — every questionnaire
 * completion offers goal-labeled bridges to its spine neighbors in *both* directions, questions
 * are phrased to read naturally whether the user is planning something new or documenting
 * something that exists, and every question is skippable (a requirement without a stakeholder,
 * a process without a role, are legitimate lightweight models).
 *
 * Question wording is grounded in each type's `create_when` guidance
 * (`/api/authoring-guidance`); the behavioural core (role/process/service) lives in the
 * **common** domain in this ontology, not business. `nameHint` gives beginners a concrete
 * example of a well-formed name (shown as the name input's placeholder).
