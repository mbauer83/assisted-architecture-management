"""Target-population classification for honest empty/degenerate results.

A result's entities fall into three classes against the definition's declared TARGET
population: targets (the substantive types the viewpoint is about), incidental
substantive content (in scope and populated, but not the target), and structural helpers
(junctions/groupings — connective tissue, never substantive content). The header can then
say exactly what is absent and what IS shown.

The target population is a PRESENTATION-level declaration. In scope mode it may be
derived mechanically from the ACTIVE scope (minus structural helpers); in query mode it
must be declared explicitly — an expressive query cannot generally be reduced to a type
set. When it is UNKNOWN, absence claims are SUPPRESSED entirely: a guessed absence claim
is exactly the false copy this classification exists to prevent.
