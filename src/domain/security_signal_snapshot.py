"""Security signal-snapshot lifecycle: state machine, idempotent-replay decisions,
and the canonical bundle digest.

A signal snapshot is the atomic unit of security-signal ingestion: one anchor, one
staged population of components/aliases/vulnerabilities/findings, one atomic
activation. Metrics only ever read the single active snapshot per anchor.

Lifecycle: ``staging → complete → active → superseded`` plus the terminal
``staging → failed``. Status never doubles as a timestamp — activation and
supersession carry their own fields. ``failed`` is TERMINAL: replaying the same
request returns the stored failure and instructs the caller to use a new
``request_id``; it never resumes.

Idempotency: ``(anchor_entity_id, request_id)`` is the replay key (one bundle
has exactly one anchor); ``request_payload_digest`` is the SHA-256 of the
canonical accepted bundle — every semantic field after normalization,
deliberately NOT the BOM digest (the BOM is not the whole command).
