"""Fork lineage computation for viewpoint definitions.

A fork's provenance must bind to IMMUTABLE content: versions are hand-edited integers, so
``slug + version`` alone cannot establish what a fork was forked from. Lineage therefore
carries a canonical content digest of the origin at fork time (plus the model index
generation), and staleness is decided by digest comparison — editing the origin flips
every fork's badge even when nobody bumped the origin's version integer.
