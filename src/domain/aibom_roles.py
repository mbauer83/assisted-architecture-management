"""AIBOM derivation-role vocabulary and bindings (PLAN-aibom-model-derived.md §5).

The exporter fills a **closed** set of named derivation roles — it must know what each means
to place it in the ML-BOM. HOW a repository expresses each role is **open**: a role binds to
the connection type(s) and target specialization(s) that realise it, and a repo may override
the binding for its own conventions. The roles are closed; the bindings are open.

This module is pure domain: the vocabulary, the typed binding record, a parser that rejects
an unknown role name (never silently ignores it), and a per-role override merge. Loading the
shipped defaults and the repo override, and consuming the bindings during derivation, live in
the application/infrastructure layers (Streams A-loader and B).
