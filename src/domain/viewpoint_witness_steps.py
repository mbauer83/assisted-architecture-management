"""Ordered witness steps for a derived connection.

A derived relationship's raw ``via_connection_ids`` are NOT guaranteed to be in
source-to-target traversal order (the derivation engine can extend a composed chain from
either end), so ID membership alone is not a readable path. This module reconstructs the
walk once, server-side: step N connects the chain's position N to position N+1, each step
carrying the real connection's identity, endpoints, type, and its orientation relative to
the walk. Ties (two remaining witness connections incident to the same position — not
producible by a single composed chain, but guarded anyway) break deterministically by
connection id, so the same input always renders the same path.
