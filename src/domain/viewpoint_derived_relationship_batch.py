"""Batched relationship-derived attribute evaluation: every entity needing a given
`traversal: derived` attribute is folded into one `derive_relationships` call over their
combined anchor set, instead of one call per entity.

`derive_relationships` already treats its `anchors` parameter as a set representing shared
reachability — `resolve_neighbor_inclusions` has relied on this for a multi-entity primary
population since it shipped. Each resulting relationship is attributed by its own recorded
`source_id`/`target_id`, so folding many entities into one combined anchor set produces,
for each entity, exactly the relationships a solo single-anchor call for that entity alone
would have — the BFS discovers every anchor's own local neighborhood at hop 0 before any
anchor's deeper frontier is explored, so no anchor's own directly-reachable relationships
are ever shadowed by another anchor's traversal. Composing the fold once and re-attributing
by endpoint is what keeps this at the plan's stated bounded-reachability complexity per
execution, rather than multiplying it by the number of entities being evaluated.
