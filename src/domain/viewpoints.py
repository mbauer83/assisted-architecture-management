"""Domain model for viewpoints: definitions, applications, and the concept-level catalog
they live in.

A ``ViewpointDefinition`` narrows a diagram type's ``ConceptScope`` and, independently, may
carry an ``ExecutableViewpointQuery`` (on-demand selection, criteria trees from
``viewpoint_criteria.py``) and a ``PresentationSpec`` (how a result is displayed) — a
definition with a query is directly executable against the live model, producing an
ephemeral result with no diagram or matrix artifact involved. ``ViewpointApplication`` is a
separate, optional concept: it records one *persisted* diagram's or matrix's use of a
definition to narrow its authoring scope, pinned to a specific version so drift is explicit
rather than silent. Parsing lives in ``viewpoint_parsing.py``; registry-aware correctness in
``viewpoint_validation.py``.
