"""Splits a query's declared derived attributes into the subset actually referenced by a
criteria tree (which must stay computed eagerly, over the full scoped candidate population,
since matching can't be decided without them) and the subset that is not (which is only
ever consumed by presentation — style tokens, label attributes — for whichever entities
survive filtering).

Per the evaluation-pipeline contract, derived attributes are meant to be computed lazily,
memoized per (entity, attribute) — never for entities the query has no other reason to
touch. A presentation-only derived attribute (the common case: a heat-map `scale_attribute`
that never appears in a condition) has no bearing on which entities match, so eagerly
evaluating it for the entire scoped population before filtering is pure waste — and each
evaluation of a `traversal: derived` attribute is a full bounded relationship-derivation
search, so that waste scales with population size times per-entity derivation cost, not
with the (usually much smaller) number of entities that actually end up in the result.
