"""Deployment identity: value objects for the two-stage layout resolution.

One pure resolver (`deployment_layout_resolution`) decides which settings
document governs a deployment (stage 1) and where every operational path lives
(stage 2), so `arch-repair upgrade`, Docker startup, and runtime composition
can never disagree about which physical stores belong to a deployment. Every
resolved value carries its source; explicit sources that disagree are a hard
error before any store is opened or created.
