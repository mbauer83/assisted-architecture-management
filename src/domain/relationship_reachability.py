    `derive_relationships` invocation — safe because the read-model never changes
    mid-request. Without this, `_adjacent_connections` re-fetches the same entity's
    connections from the underlying (dual-repo, thread-dispatched) store every time that
    entity is revisited across different partial BFS paths; for a bounded traversal that
    is genuinely the standard graph-search invariant every BFS/Dijkstra/A* relies on
    (each node's adjacency list is read at most once), not an optional optimization —
    without it, redundant re-fetching turns a bounded-hop traversal into work proportional
    to the number of *paths* examined rather than the number of *entities* touched.

    Correctness depends entirely on this cache never outliving one call: construct it
    fresh inside `derive_relationships` and never elsewhere — never store an instance on
    a longer-lived object, pass it in as a parameter, or reuse it across calls. A cache
    that outlives a single call would observe stale reads across write events; a cache
    scoped to one call never can, since the read-model cannot change mid-call and each
