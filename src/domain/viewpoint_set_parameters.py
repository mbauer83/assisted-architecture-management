"""Canonicalization and static validation for SET-VALUED (``cardinality: many``) parameters.

A set-valued runtime value is an ordered, duplicate-free tuple, so any permutation or
repetition canonicalizes identically — which is what makes a shared URL, a REST array, and a
CSV provenance column round-trip to the same execution.

Canonical order depends on the vocabulary, and both orders are deterministic:
* CLOSED (``allowed_values`` declared) — declaration order, so the author controls it.
* OPEN (no vocabulary, e.g. a group filter) — sorted, since there is no author-given order.

Membership is only *enforced* for a closed vocabulary. An open set accepts anything: a value
naming nothing in the model yields an empty result, never an error, so a saved filter does not
break when the model changes underneath it.
