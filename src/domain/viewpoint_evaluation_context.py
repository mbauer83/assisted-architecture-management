"""Shared context types for the pure criteria evaluator: the
read-access surface it needs for adjacency/endpoint lookups, and the outcome shape every
evaluation function returns.

``CriteriaReadAccess`` is deliberately narrow and structurally identical to the relevant
slice of the existing ``ArtifactLookup``/``RelationshipGraph`` application ports
(``src/application/ports.py``) — any real artifact store already satisfies it, so no new
port or adapter is needed to wire a live evaluator, per the standing "use existing read
ports" rule. Direction filtering is always done by the evaluator itself (symmetric-type
normalization lives in ``viewpoint_criteria_evaluation.py``), so callers only ever pass
``direction="any"`` here and let the evaluator narrow further.
