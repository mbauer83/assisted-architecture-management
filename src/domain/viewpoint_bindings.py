    (the coverage ``scope``) and an open set of slugs (a ``group`` filter) differ only by
    ``allowed_values``, and future element kinds compose for free.

    ``allowed_values`` present = a CLOSED vocabulary, enforced at bind time. Absent = an OPEN
    vocabulary whose members are whatever the caller supplies (a nonexistent value yields an
    empty result rather than an error, so the filter never breaks on model change).
