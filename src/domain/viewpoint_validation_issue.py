"""The structured issue type ``validate_viewpoint_definition`` returns (companion plan §7.2).

Deliberately distinct from the artifact verifier's ``Issue`` (E180/W180/W181/W182): the
verifier judges *artifacts against the model*; this type judges *definitions against the
catalogs* — different lifecycles, different consumers, no shared code space.
