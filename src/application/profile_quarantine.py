"""Class B quarantine (PLAN §4): a ``(type, specialization)`` pair whose bound profiles
conflict with each other or the base schema on an attribute's type. The rest of the model
stays well-defined, so the failure is confined to the pair — reads continue, but a
create/edit for that pair is rejected at the write boundary (WU-Q3).

Both concept kinds are covered by the same machinery: an entity type with its attribute
schema, and a connection type with its metadata schema, are quarantined for identical
reasons and must be refused identically. Only the resolver differs, and that difference is
one lookup here.

Quarantine is computed on demand from ``(repo, catalogs)`` and never persisted — the same
discipline as the schema resolution it wraps — so it self-clears the moment the conflicting
profiles or bindings change. Class A (an undefined binding) is a startup concern: it aborts
the engagement repo at boot (WU-Q1) and therefore never reaches a running write boundary, so
here every conflict is Class B (scoped).
