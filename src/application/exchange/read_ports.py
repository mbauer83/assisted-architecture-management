"""Narrow read ports for the exchange import/export use cases (D10, parent plan §4.5,
WU-F3a/F3b): each use case needs only a slice of the full ``ArtifactStorePort`` surface, so
each slice is its own Protocol — independently fakeable in tests, and satisfied structurally
by ``ArtifactRegistry`` without requiring its unrelated methods.
