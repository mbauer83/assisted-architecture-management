"""derived-relationships/v1 strategy: candidate set = entities/connections reachable
from ``root_entity_ids`` via bounded relationship derivation (Appendix B) — modeled
connections along witness chains flow through by id; derived relationships flow through
as candidate witness paths, never as synthetic connection ids (the standing "derived
relationships are never persisted" invariant). Same acceptance defaults as
``viewpoint_execution``: certain candidates pre-included, potential ones pre-excluded
until explicitly accepted.

Pure application logic only: ``catalog`` (the ontology ``ModuleCatalog`` the derivation
engine reads its rule tables from) is injected by the composition-root registration
closure (``src.infrastructure.derivation_strategy_wiring``) — a ``ModelQuery``-only
``derive_fn`` cannot build one itself (ontology-catalog construction lives at the
composition root; same gap, same resolution, as ``viewpoint_execution``).
