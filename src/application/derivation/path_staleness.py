"""Reconstruction-based staleness classification for accepted witness paths.

Re-derives each accepted path fresh via the shared reconstruction logic and classifies
the outcome against what was recorded at acceptance time (``PathProvenance``): broken
(a connection in the chain no longer exists or has a missing/unknown endpoint),
no-longer-derives (the chain is structurally intact but no rule composes it anymore), or
drift (the chain still derives, but as a different certainty or connection type than
what was accepted) — never silently redrawn or dropped, per the standing "the architect
re-reviews" contract. A bare path-key set-membership check (whether the key still
appears in a freshly computed candidate set) cannot see drift at all: the path key only
names which connections form the chain, never the type/certainty the composition
resolves to, so reconstruction is the only way to detect it.
