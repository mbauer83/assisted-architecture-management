"""Resolve a persisted diagram's accepted witness paths into renderable connection
records: reconstructs each accepted path fresh via ``derive_relationship_for_path`` (the
only function rendering ever consumes for a derived connection — the same reconstruction
``path_staleness.py`` uses for staleness classification) and synthesizes a renderer-only
``ConnectionRecord`` per successful outcome. A broken or no-longer-derives path never
silently redraws or drops — it is a staleness finding, not a rendering fallback, so it is
simply omitted here and left to ``classify_accepted_path_staleness`` to surface."""
