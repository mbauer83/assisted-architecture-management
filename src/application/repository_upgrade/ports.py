"""Ports for the `arch-repair upgrade` framework.

`RepoUpgradeView` gives a step's pure `detect()` read access to one repo root.
`RepoUpgradeWriter` is the only way `apply()` may mutate that repo, so every step's write
surface goes through the same adapter (filesystem in production, in-memory in tests).
