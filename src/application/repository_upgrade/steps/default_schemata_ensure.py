"""Detector/migrator for shipped default attribute + frontmatter schemata.

Probes the exact `.arch-repo/schemata/` filenames the product ships defaults for:
a missing file is auto-added with the shipped payload; a present same-named file
is preserved byte-for-byte, and reported (info) only when it structurally differs
from the shipped default — an operator's local edit is never overwritten and never
silently drifts out of sight.
