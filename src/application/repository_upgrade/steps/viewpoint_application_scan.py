"""Read-only detector for diagram/matrix `viewpoint:` frontmatter (D8): flags a value that
fails to parse. `parse_viewpoint_application` already raises loudly for a malformed shape
(missing `slug`, non-integer version, unknown `enforcement_override`) — but the live
verifier's `check_viewpoint_application` calls it unguarded, so today that raise crashes the
verify pass for the whole file rather than producing a clean report entry. `arch-repair
upgrade` turns the same signal into a proactive, non-crashing finding.

Always manual: the malformed value has no unambiguous auto-rewrite.
