"""Read-only detector for `.arch-repo/schemata/*.schema.json` (D13 profiles): flags a schema
file that is not valid JSON. Covers all three naming conventions
`artifact_schema.py` documents — `frontmatter.*`, `attributes.{type}[.{slug}]`, and
`connection-metadata.*` — since they share one failure mode (malformed JSON) and one
directory. A base-type attribute schema (`attributes.{type}.schema.json`) IS today's
persisted form of a "profile" (D13): there is no longer a separate `.arch-repo/profiles.yaml`
(see the profile/specialization design correction), so this is the profiles surface's
current on-disk shape.

Deliberately narrow: orphaned specialization-attachment schemata (a *valid* JSON file whose
slug matches no declared specialization) are already caught live by the W044 verifier rule
against the fully merged catalog — duplicating that here would need widening
`RepoUpgradeView` for a check that never silently passes today. This step only covers what
that live check can't: a schema file so malformed it would raise before any rule gets to run.
