"""Catch-all anomaly detector: flags file structure this software recognizes
neither as current nor as any registered legacy pattern, so an old/drifted repo's upgrade
report is honestly incomplete-looking rather than falsely clean.

Deliberately narrow (avoid false-positive noise on ordinary content this step simply
doesn't have an opinion about): only frontmatter-bearing markdown files (content starting
with ``---``) are considered, and only three signals are checked — malformed/unparseable
frontmatter, a missing ``artifact-type``, or an ``artifact-type`` value that isn't a known
literal or a currently-registered entity type. Connection-record files (``source-entity``
present, no ``artifact-type`` by design) are excluded. Always manual — this step never
attempts a rewrite, it only raises attention.
