"""Read-only detector for `.arch-repo/specializations.yaml` (D4/D6): flags a declarations
file that fails to parse, so drift in this new, repo-local customization file surfaces in
`arch-repair upgrade` even when the full backend/verifier never runs against this repo.

Always manual: a malformed declarations file has no single unambiguous auto-rewrite (the
author's intent for the broken entry isn't recoverable), so this step only ever reports.
