"""Read-only detector for the per-connection metadata block (D6): flags a fenced ```yaml
block under a `### ` connection heading that fails to parse as a mapping.

This is a genuinely silent gap, not just a proactive echo of an already-loud live check:
`parse_connection_declarations` deliberately reinterprets a malformed fence as ordinary body
prose (so a broken block never crashes a read), and the live verifier's
`check_connection_metadata_schema` call is itself gated on `decl.metadata` being truthy — so
today a malformed metadata block produces zero warning anywhere. `arch-repair upgrade` is the
first thing to actually surface it.

Always manual: the author's intended metadata can't be reconstructed from broken YAML.
