"""Read-only detector for `.arch-repo/viewpoints.yaml` (D7/D8): flags a declarations file
that fails to parse, mirroring `SpecializationDeclarationScanStep` for the other new
two-tier customization file. `viewpoint_catalog_from_mapping` already rejects unknown keys
and malformed enum values loudly at load time — this step turns that same check into a
proactive `arch-repair upgrade` finding instead of a crash the first time something loads it.

Always manual, for the same reason as the specialization declarations scan.
