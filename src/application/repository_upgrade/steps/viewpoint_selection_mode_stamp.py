"""Stamp the persisted ``selection_mode`` onto pre-change viewpoint definitions.

Scope and query are ALTERNATIVE selection mechanisms; exactly one is active. Pre-change
definitions carry no mode, so this step stamps one mechanically wherever the layers
cannot disagree: scope-only → ``scope``; query-only and dual-EQUIVALENT (the query is the
scope's mechanical translation) → ``query``. A dual-DIVERGENT definition selects two
different populations, so its mode is never guessed: the operator states it with
``--resolve-selection <slug>=scope|query`` (a resolution writes ONLY ``selection_mode``,
never a semantic conversion of either layer). Any divergent definition left unresolved
makes the whole commit run exit with the distinct unresolved-migration status and write
nothing anywhere (``blocks_commit``). Re-running on a migrated deployment is a no-op.
