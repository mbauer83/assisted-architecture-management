"""Migrate viewpoint presentation style values that predate per-capability validation.

Style values were opaque strings; anything a renderer did not recognize painted as the
neutral fallback. Save-time validation now rejects out-of-vocabulary values (semantic
tokens, named scale endpoints, or ``#rrggbb`` colors per capability), so a definition
carrying legacy values could no longer be re-saved unchanged. This step rewrites those
values to ``neutral`` — byte-identical to what they already rendered as — and leaves a
per-definition record of every replacement so authors can pick real colors afterwards.

The rewrite re-serializes ``viewpoints.yaml`` through the same domain mapping +
``yaml.safe_dump(..., sort_keys=False)`` the authoring save path uses, so an upgraded
file is exactly what the next GUI/MCP save would produce anyway.
