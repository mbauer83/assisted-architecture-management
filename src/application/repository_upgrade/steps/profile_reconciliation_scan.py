"""Reconciliation reporter for named profile conflicts (WU-R1).

Detect-only and non-destructive — mirroring ``DefaultSchemataEnsureStep``'s contract, it
never rewrites operator content. For every specialization the repo declares that binds
named profiles — entity and connection alike — it resolves the effective schema and reports
each incompatible-type conflict as a quarantined ``(type, specialization)`` pair (the
profiles/field/types are named in the merge message). Proposed resolutions (rename /
align-type / unbind, and safe auto-migration) are WU-R2.

Content-version DRIFT (a shipped profile advanced past a repo customisation — what P4's
per-profile ``version`` exists for) is NOT reported here yet: no reusable profiles are
shipped, so there is no baseline to drift from. When shipped profiles land, the drift
comparison activates by giving this step the shipped registry (the same way
``known_entity_type_names`` reaches a step — an ``RepoUpgradeView`` property fed by the
module registry through the adapter).
