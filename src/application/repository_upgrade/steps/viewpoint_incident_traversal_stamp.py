"""Stamp the implicit incident-predicate traversal explicitly in saved viewpoints.

An incident condition saved without a ``traversal`` key has always executed as ``direct``,
but the meaning lived in the parser default rather than in the file — a future default
change would silently alter every saved recipe. Serialization now always writes the
predicate's traversal; this step brings pre-change files up to that contract by
re-serializing through the same domain mapping + ``yaml.safe_dump(..., sort_keys=False)``
the authoring save path uses. Pure stamping: every predicate keeps its parsed value, so
the rewrite never changes what a definition matches.
