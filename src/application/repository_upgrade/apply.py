"""ApplyRepositoryUpgrade: the `--commit` use case.

Runs every registered step whose `detect()` reports findings, applies it through the write/
index ports, rebuilds the index once, and stamps the repo's `.arch-repo/config.yaml`. A repo
that is already fully up to date touches nothing at all — no rewrites, no index rebuild, no
config write — so `--commit` is a true no-op and safe to run unconditionally (e.g. as a
pre-start check in a deployment) on a repo nothing needs to change in.
