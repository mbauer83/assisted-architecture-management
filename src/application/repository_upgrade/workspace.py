"""Multi-repo aggregation for `arch-repair upgrade --workspace`.

Each repo root is evaluated/applied independently (one unit = one repo root). A target
raising unexpectedly (foreseeable failure modes already isolated inside `apply_repository`
itself — this is defense-in-depth for anything that still escapes) never discards the
reports already collected for other targets; it is captured as an error entry for that
target's report instead.
