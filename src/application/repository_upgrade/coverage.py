"""D17 coverage invariant: every `ScannedSurface` this plan introduced must have at least
one registered step or read-only detector — enforced here rather than left as a manual
inventory, so a future format surface added without a step fails a test instead of silently
lacking coverage.

`REQUIRED_STEP_IDS_BY_SURFACE` is keyed by every `ScannedSurface` literal
(`typing.get_args`-derived, so a new literal with no entry here is itself a coverage gap).
