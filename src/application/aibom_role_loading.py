"""Resolve AIBOM derivation-role bindings for a repository: the module-shipped defaults with
an optional ``.arch-repo/aibom-roles.yaml`` override merged per-role over them.

The override file is OPTIONAL — its absence means "use the shipped bindings", the state
every repository is in until it declares different modelling conventions. A present but
malformed file, or one naming a role outside the closed vocabulary, is a ``DerivationRoleError``
(the parser's typed error) for the caller to report against the file.
