"""Operational migration: bring a security-signals database to the signal-snapshot
schema (versioned ``signals_schema_meta`` + the snapshot aggregate tables).

The signal-snapshot aggregate is the sole signals model; metrics read only the
active snapshot. The public SQLite backend is deprecated for metrics but its schema
is kept current for queryability.

Two conditions are detected. An OUTDATED store (below the current version) migrates
automatically. A PRE-RENAME store — stamped at the current version but still carrying
the old ``security_refresh_runs`` tables — cannot be migrated: the version-2 DDL was
renamed in place during pre-alpha rather than versioned forward, so there is no
upgrade path and the store must be recreated. That case is reported as a blocking,
non-auto-migratable finding rather than left to fail later as a missing table."""
