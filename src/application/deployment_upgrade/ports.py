"""Ports for deployment-scoped operational upgrade targets.

Operational targets (guidance cache, signal stores, the deployment settings
document) are never forced through `RepoUpgradeWriter` — each kind gets its own
view/unit-of-work pair. Databases migrate through one transactional migration
connection per target; text-file targets write atomically (temp + rename).
