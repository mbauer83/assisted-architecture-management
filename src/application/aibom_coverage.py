"""AIBOM coverage evaluation (PLAN-aibom-model-derived.md Stream B / WU-B3).

The honest answer to "what is missing for a valid AIBOM" — per AI component: required
attributes the entity has not authored, missing dataset linkage, a missing governance edge,
and (repo-wide) derivation roles no connection type is bound to. Pure: it reads the already-
derived components plus the per-specialization required-attribute sets; no IO.

A gap is a *finding*, never an error or a silent omission — an AI component with no dataset
link still exports, it just reports the gap so the operator can act.
