"""AIBOM derivation core (PLAN-aibom-model-derived.md Stream B) — the differentiator.

A PURE projection: AI-specialized entities + connections + resolved role bindings → a typed
AIBOM component set, each field marked derived-from-relationships or authored-on-the-entity,
with authored winning (D5). No IO, no store access, no HTTP — everything comes in as
arguments so the whole engine is unit-testable in isolation.

Datasets come from the ``trained-on`` / ``evaluated-on`` / ``fine-tuned-from`` role
bindings; governance from the ``governed-by`` binding; the BOM dependency graph from
connections between two AI components. What the entity authored (its Properties, already
decoded onto ``EntityRecord.attributes``) is carried verbatim and overrides any derived
value for the same field.
