"""Diagram/matrix viewpoint-application verifier rule: unknown slug (E180, always an
error), stale pinned version (W180), out-of-scope placed entity/connection (W181), and
criteria-mismatch placed entity/connection (W182) — distinct from metamodel-violation codes
elsewhere in this package. W180/W181/W182 are suppressed entirely when the effective
enforcement setting is ``off``; both ``warn`` and ``ghost`` still emit them, since ghosting is
a GUI rendering behavior applied independently of this check — a CI/`arch-repo verify` run
should still see the same signal the GUI ghosts.

Obtains its artifact-local projection from ``project_artifact_local`` (companion plan §6.2/
§6.3) — the same application service the GUI's ghost/hide overlay consumes — rather than
re-implementing scope/criteria evaluation here.
