"""Execution-scoped graph index for branch-complete trace evaluation.

Built ONCE per execution and shared across every row and pattern — the deliberate answer to
the rescan-per-row cost that makes the ad-hoc coverage view slow. It holds:

* a direct adjacency index over ONLY the connection types the patterns reference, keyed
  ``(node, conn_type) -> neighbours`` in both directions (branch enumeration is direct-stored
  edges only — derived edges would collapse the very branches this view quantifies over);
* per-entity type / domain / status maps and per-type class memberships (for leaf layer
  membership and the deprecated/retired scope policy);
* a per-requirement realizer closure = direct incoming realization UNION the result of ONE
  batched ``derive_relationships`` call over all requirement anchors (derived relationships are
  ≥2-hop and returned one-per-pair, so the direct 1-hop edges must be added from the index).

Complexity: O(E) to build adjacency (``connection_ids`` + O(1) ``get_connection``, never a
per-entity query), O(N) for the entity maps, and ONE bounded derivation pass; leaf coverage is
then a memoised set lookup per requirement reused by every row/pattern.
