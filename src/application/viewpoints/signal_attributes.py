"""Signal-derived attribute orchestration for viewpoint evaluation.

Partitioned out of the pure graph evaluation path: attributes with
``source: security-signal`` are batch-fetched from the injected capability
(one call per phase — criteria-referenced attributes over the full scoped
candidate set, presentation-only ones over the retained population) and merged
into the evaluation environment under the same ``(entity_id, name)`` keys the
graph evaluator uses. An unavailable batch merges nothing and yields one
explicit warning — values from different snapshots are never mixed.
