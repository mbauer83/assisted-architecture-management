"""The registry-derived eligible realizer set for the branch-complete leaf check
(``endpoint: {registry: permitted-realizers-of-requirement}``).

A requirement's terminal obligation is covered when an incoming realization chain reaches ANY
element whose type is *permitted by the ontology* to realize a requirement — across every
family (common behavior, business, application, technology, physical, strategy, implementation/
migration) — MINUS motivation-only refiners (realization between motivation elements is
refinement, not implementation) and the junction/grouping structural helpers. Derived once per
execution from the aggregated permitted-relationship rules, so adding a family to the ontology
extends coverage with no code change.
