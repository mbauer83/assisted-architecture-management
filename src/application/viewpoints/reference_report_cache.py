"""On-demand, never-persisted memoisation of ``reference_report``.

The report is a pure function of (definition, current model). Persisting it would repeat the
rename-stale-index failure mode and would not self-clear when the model changes back, so it
is recomputed on demand and cached only in-process, keyed by ``(index_generation, definition
digest)`` — the same staleness key fork status uses.

SOUNDNESS INVARIANT: the registries and read model passed to a given ``index_generation`` are
a pure function OF that generation — any model revision (including retiring a type, which is
itself an artifact edit) bumps the generation. So a bumped generation or an edited definition
(new digest) is a cache miss and a reference that comes back self-heals. When
``index_generation`` is ``None`` (ad-hoc execution with no model-version stamp) the cache is
bypassed entirely, so callers that vary the registries independently of a generation stamp
never observe a stale hit.
