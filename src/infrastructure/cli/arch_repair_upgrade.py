"""`arch-repair upgrade` subcommand: version-aware repo upgrade.

Dry-run/report is always allowed (backend running or not) and never mutates. `--commit`, in
order:
  1. refuses when a backend serves the target repo — the **only** hard, non-overridable
     gate. This is the actual consistency invariant: two writers touching the same files.
     Runs before anything else touches disk.
  2. sweeps orphaned atomic-write temp files a previous, killed run may have left behind;
  3. recovers any transaction left mid-flight by a crashed backend (the same idempotent
     `recover_transactions` the backend itself runs at startup), so upgrade steps always see a
     consistent repo regardless of git-sync/promotion history;
  4. applies. Git status is deliberately **not** a gate. An out-of-date-and-actively-used
     repo — the exact situation this command exists for — routinely has uncommitted edits to
     the very files that need migrating (entity frontmatter, profiles, connection
     declarations); requiring a clean tree first would make `--commit` fail on the common
     case, not the rare one. It's also not a safety property: every step does
     read-current-content → transform → write-back against whatever is on disk *right now*,
     committed or not, so an uncommitted edit is carried forward into the rewrite, never
     clobbered or lost — git cleanliness has no bearing on correctness here, only on how easy
     the resulting diff is to read. So a touched-file/dirty-file overlap is reported as an
     informational note (which files, so the operator knows to review the combined diff
     before committing) and nothing more.

Resumability: every step's `detect()` re-derives its finding from actual repo content, never
from the `.arch-repo/config.yaml` applied-steps stamp — the stamp is metadata for reporting
only. Combined with atomic (temp+rename) writes and per-step/per-repo failure isolation (see
`apply.py`/`workspace.py`), this means `--commit` may be interrupted at any point (killed
process, crash, power loss) and safely re-run from scratch: partially-applied repos, stale
stamps, and stray temp files are all self-healing on the next invocation.
See `src.infrastructure.repository_upgrade.guard`.
