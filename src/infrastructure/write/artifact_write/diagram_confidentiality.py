"""Confidentiality routing for assurance diagram sources.

Rule G-f keeps *rendered* assurance images off disk. The same confidentiality boundary must
cover the diagram *source*: an assurance diagram whose classification is above the
publishability ceiling carries sensitive analysis content (bowtie/GSN/UCA node labels) in its
frontmatter and PUML body, so its `.puml` must not land in the git-tracked catalog.

Confidentiality is driven by the TLP classification (see ``src.domain.classification``), not a
blanket per-type flag: an assurance diagram explicitly classified TLP:WHITE/GREEN is
publishable (renders and persists to the catalog like any diagram — this is what lets the
self-describing model ship a public assurance example), while anything above that, or
unclassified, is confidential and is redirected to a gitignored location.
