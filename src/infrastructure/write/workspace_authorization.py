Composes a fresh immutable ``AuthorizationSnapshot`` per operation from the
configured repository roots, the backend mode flags, the live workspace mutation
gate, and the persisted enterprise sync health. Constructed only at composition

    ``sync_health`` is a callable so every snapshot re-reads the persisted health
    overlay; it defaults to healthy until a persisted-health reader is wired in.

    Performance contract: snapshots are composed on EVERY mutation (twice — at
    submission and again inside the worker) and on every status request, so every
    input must be O(1) and independent of model size: roots are resolved once at
    construction, the gate read is a single uncontended lock acquisition, and any
    injected ``sync_health`` reader must serve from process memory kept current by
    the persisting aggregate — never a per-call file parse or git invocation.
    Serialized writes are file-I/O-bound (milliseconds); authorization must stay
    microseconds so it never becomes the write queue's bottleneck.
