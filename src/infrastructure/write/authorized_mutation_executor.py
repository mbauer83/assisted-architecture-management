"""Concrete AuthorizedMutationExecutor.

Composes the shared single-worker write queue with the workspace mutation gate:

    authorize (fresh snapshot) → ONE queue submission → fresh re-check inside the
    worker → gate acquired exactly once → execute the operation.

Handlers migrated onto this executor surrender their own queue/gate wrapping —
the executor owns the single submission; nested submission to the single-worker
queue deadlocks and is therefore forbidden by construction, not convention.
