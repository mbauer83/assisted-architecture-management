"""Build the FTS row for a diagram, including the names of the entities it contains.

A diagram is discoverable by its own title/type and by the names of its member
entities — diagram-local nodes (resolved via ``host_diagram_id``) and bound workspace
entities (matrix axes, C4 bindings). The resolved member names occupy the
``member_names`` FTS column.
