"""Reads the architecture model to describe a prospective signal anchor.

The adapter behind the ``AnchorReader`` port. The dependency runs assurance →
architecture, which is the direction the codebase already establishes: assurance
reads and references architecture through ports (``ArchitectureEntityCreator`` in
model-and-bind, the one-way arch references); architecture never depends on
assurance.

Resolution goes through the index's own canonical-id handling, so either anchor id
form resolves — the same normalization ``anchor_key`` applies on the storage side.
The index spans BOTH repositories where an enterprise repo is configured, so an
anchor promoted to enterprise still resolves.
