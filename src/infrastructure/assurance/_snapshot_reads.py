"""Read queries over the signal-snapshot aggregate.

Anchors arrive in either id form — the GUI navigates by the full slugged artifact
id, scripts and MCP callers use the short one — and SQL matches by exact equality,
so every anchor crossing this boundary goes through ``anchor_key``. Without that,
a snapshot written under one form is invisible to a reader using the other, which
surfaces as "no active snapshot" rather than as an error.
