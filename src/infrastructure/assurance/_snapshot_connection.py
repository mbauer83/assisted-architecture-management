"""Connection acquisition and transaction framing for the signal-snapshot store.

Made an explicit collaborator rather than private methods on the adapter. The
snapshot operations are split across several modules by concern, and each of them
needs a connection; passing this object states that dependency instead of having
each module reach into the adapter's protected members.

Opening also applies the PRAGMAs and brings the schema current, so no caller can
work with a half-configured connection.
