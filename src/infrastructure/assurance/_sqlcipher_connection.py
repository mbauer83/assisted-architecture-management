"""Thread-local SQLCipher connection management for the assurance store.

SQLite/SQLCipher connection objects are bound to the thread that created them, but
the store is a process singleton served from a pool of OS threads (the anyio
threadpool for sync REST handlers + FastMCP tool execution). This manager gives
each accessing thread its own lazily-opened, cached connection, opened in **WAL**
mode with a busy timeout so concurrent readers do not block one another or the
writer. A generation counter invalidates cached connections across lock/unlock
cycles; every open connection is tracked so ``close()`` disposes them all. The
encryption key is held in process memory only between ``open()`` and ``close()``.

Write *serialisation* (single-writer discipline) is a separate concern handled at
the MCP/REST boundary by the assurance write queue — this manager only guarantees
that any thread can safely obtain a connection.
