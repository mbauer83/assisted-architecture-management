"""Write queue — serializes all model write operations through a single worker.

Concurrent write calls (artifact_create_entity, artifact_add_connection, etc.) race on
shared .md files and the SQLite index when issued in parallel. This module provides
a single-worker ThreadPoolExecutor that drains write operations serially: each call
is accepted immediately and returns its result as soon as it completes, but only one
write runs at a time.

MCP mutation tools do not use this module directly: they register through
``mutation_registration.register_mutation_tool``, whose executor submits via
``submit_serialized`` and owns the workspace gate. ``run_sync`` remains for
REST handlers not yet migrated onto the executor.
