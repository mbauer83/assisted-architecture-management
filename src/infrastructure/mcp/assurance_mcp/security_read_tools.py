"""Security-signal read-only MCP tools.

Tools registered on arch-assurance-read:
  assurance_list_bom_components  — components of the anchor's ACTIVE signal snapshot
  assurance_list_vulnerabilities — vulnerability findings of the active snapshot
  assurance_vulnerability_impact — REVERSE lookup: which entities one vulnerability affects
  assurance_security_stats       — signal-snapshot aggregate counts
  assurance_security_metrics     — posture metrics from the active signal snapshot + VEX
  assurance_scan_ai_candidates   — heuristic AI-BOM candidate scan
  assurance_aibom_export         — emit CycloneDX 1.6 ML-BOM from provided components JSON

All read the signal-snapshot model. Confidential-backend reads are gated behind store-unlock
and filtered by the max_classification TLP ceiling before return.
