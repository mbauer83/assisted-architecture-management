"""Public coordination API for authoritative writes and background refreshes.

This module is the process-local orchestration boundary between two concerns:

- The authoritative write path, which applies targeted read-model updates
  synchronously and must preserve referential integrity.
- Background reconciliation, which absorbs out-of-band filesystem edits and
  periodic full refreshes without racing the write path.
