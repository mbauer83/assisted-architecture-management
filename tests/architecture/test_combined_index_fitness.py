"""Architectural fitness function: `combined_artifact_index` must only ever be called with a
root pair that came from `resolve_workspace_repo_roots` (or the equivalent already-resolved
`_repo_root`/`_enterprise_root` state threaded through `gui_state`/`context.py`), never a
caller-supplied arbitrary pair.

`combined_artifact_index` is deliberately narrower than `shared_artifact_index` (exactly two
required positional `Path` arguments, see `PLAN-canonical-artifact-index.md`'s "Proposed
direction") specifically so this discipline is checkable: a call site passing a literal
`Path(...)` construction or a string-literal path directly as an argument would bypass whatever
resolution the rest of the codebase relies on. This test is the mechanical guard against that —
in the same spirit as `tests/architecture/test_index_broadcast_policy.py`'s allowlist audit.
