"""Architectural fitness function: every write-commit path must broadcast.

Multiple independently-cached `ArtifactIndex` singletons can exist for the same physical repo
(one per distinct root-set/scope — see `bootstrap.get_shared_index`). A write committed by calling
`ArtifactIndex.apply_file_changes` directly on just one of them left every sibling singleton
silently stale until a manual `artifact_admin_reindex` — e.g. `artifact_delete_entity` (engagement-
only scope) reporting "not found" for an entity the GUI (engagement+enterprise-combined scope) had
just created. Fixed by routing every write-commit path through `notify_paths_changed`
(`bootstrap.py`), which already applies a change to *every* live registered index whose mounts
overlap it.

This test is the guard against the same class of bug recurring: a call to
`.apply_file_changes(`/`.apply_file_change(` anywhere outside the small, explicitly-reviewed
allowlist below has bypassed the broadcast and is a real, live regression of the fixed bug — the
next such call site should use `notify_paths_changed` instead, not be added to the allowlist.

# Each entry is deliberately narrow and justified — not a blanket per-file exemption:
#   bootstrap.py       — notify_paths_changed's own broadcast loop; this IS the mechanism.
#   service.py         — ArtifactIndex calling its own method on `self` (identity reconciliation
#                         healing that one index's own stale short-id cache from disk); not an
#                         external write event that other cached indices need telling about.
#   artifact_repository.py — thin facade delegation (`ArtifactRepository.apply_file_change(s)` ->
#                         `self._store.apply_file_changes(...)`); a generic primitive on the
#                         query/search facade, not itself a write-commit hook. Do not call these
#                         two ArtifactRepository methods from a write-commit path — that was
#                         exactly the state.py bug this test guards against; broadcast via
#                         notify_paths_changed instead and read the version back afterward.
#   bulk/common.py      — local_apply_paths applies changes to a throwaway staging/dry-run temp
#                         directory's own index (`temp_repo_callbacks(staged_root)`), never the
#                         live repo; no other live singleton can share mounts with a fresh temp dir.
