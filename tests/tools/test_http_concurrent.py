"""HTTP-level concurrent-access test.

Simulates multiple browser tabs hitting the GUI REST API simultaneously.
The tests verify that:
  - Parallel GET requests do not serialize (N concurrent reads ≈ 1 read in wall time).
  - A long-running refresh (write lock held) does not block reads indefinitely once it
    releases — i.e. reads resume as soon as the write completes, not one-at-a-time.

These tests require the `gui` optional-dependency group (fastapi, httpx).
