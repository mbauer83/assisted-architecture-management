"""WU-R2: proposed resolutions for a quarantining profile conflict.

The load-bearing guarantee is the last test: an operator-authored conflict is NEVER
auto-migrated. The plan sanctions auto-migration only for advancing a file byte-identical
to an older shipped profile version, and no reusable profiles ship yet — so there is no
unambiguous case, and the resolver must offer only manual moves.
