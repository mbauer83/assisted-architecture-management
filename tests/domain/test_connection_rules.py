"""ArchiMate 4.0 connection-rule conformance.

Sentinel cases transcribed from the ArchiMate 4.0 specification's connection-rule
matrix — Appendix B.5 (direct relationships) and B.6 (grouping/junction). These
pin the loaded ontology to the normative matrix: every PERMITTED triple must be
allowed and every PROHIBITED triple must be absent. The knowledge is embedded
inline here on purpose (no external fixture file): the normative source is the
specification's matrix, and these tests are its executable transcription.

Key rules exercised:
  - internal behaviour (function / process) --realization--> service is PERMITTED
  - service --serving--> / --association-- application-component is PERMITTED
  - active technology (system-software / technology-node / device)
    --serving--> application-component is PERMITTED
  - application-component <-> service realization is PROHIBITED in both directions
    (a component does not realize a service; behaviour does)
