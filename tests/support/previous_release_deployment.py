"""Build a deployment tree as an earlier release left it.

The one definition of "a previous-release deployment", shared by the local-CLI and the
Docker upgrade tests so the two can never drift. Every artifact is written at the path the
*current* resolver resolves for that deployment root — the fixture asks the resolver where a
target lives rather than hard-coding a filename, so a change to a path default updates the
fixture automatically instead of silently stranding it.

The layout deliberately mixes surfaces the upgrade must migrate (an old-format guidance
cache, an old-schema signals database) with content it must leave alone (an operator note
beside the cache, extra keys inside a migrated document), plus an optional unreadable
encrypted store to exercise the blocking path.
