"""Regression: the confidential-store capability probe must use the credential abstraction.

It previously called `keyring.get_password` directly, which on a headless runner (no session
D-Bus) raises and is swallowed as "key absent" — so the capability stayed unavailable even
after `arch-assurance init` stored the key via the credential store (e.g. the Fernet vault).
The probe must consult `_credential_store` so it sees whatever backend the store was set up
with. The autouse fixture installs an in-memory backend that is NOT a keyring.
