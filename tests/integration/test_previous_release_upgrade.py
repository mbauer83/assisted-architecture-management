"""End-to-end upgrade of a realistic earlier-release deployment through the public CLI.

These tests drive the real upgrade registries (no fixture steps) against the shared
previous-release fixture and prove the safety contract a safe unattended upgrade rests on:

* a dry run writes nothing anywhere and reports every outdated target as pending;
* a first commit migrates every outdated target, a second commit is a no-op;
* a blocker in any discovered target prevents all writes;
* an injected failure after one target has committed yields an accurate partial report
  and a safe resuming rerun;
* a locked encrypted store is blocking, never reported "current";
* an absent store is no target and is never created or claimed migrated;
* content the migrator has no opinion about survives byte-for-byte.

``--deployment-root`` binds the guidance-cache / signals / store paths beneath the fixture
tree, so a test never touches a real global cache or store.
