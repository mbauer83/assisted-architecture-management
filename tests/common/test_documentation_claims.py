"""Documentation drift detector: everything the docs NAME must actually exist.

Prose goes stale silently. A page can describe a CLI command, an HTTP endpoint, or
an MCP tool that was renamed or deleted, and nothing fails — the reader discovers
it by typing the command and getting an error. Three real instances were found by
hand in one sitting: `arch-assurance import-sbom` documented in two pages though it
has never existed, and a capability inventory still listing adapters deleted a
month earlier.

These tests close that loop by resolving documented names against the running
code. They are deliberately about EXISTENCE, not correctness of description: a
wrong explanation is a review problem, but a name that resolves to nothing is
mechanically detectable and should never survive a commit.
