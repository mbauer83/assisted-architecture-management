"""Regression: code-generation must emit the complete vocabulary regardless of capabilities.

The frontend type unions are generated once and committed. They are decoded against every
payload the GUI might receive, so they must include the assurance vocabulary even when the
generating machine has no confidential store configured. Previously `build_module_registry`
gated the assurance ontology + diagram types on the runtime `confidential_store` capability,
so `tools/generate_types.py` produced a smaller file on a machine without the store than on
one with it — a CI drift failure. `complete_vocabulary=True` must register everything.
