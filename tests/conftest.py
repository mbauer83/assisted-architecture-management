"""Session-wide collection hooks.

Cross-test isolation ordering: a handful of tests mutate *process-global* state that other
tests rely on staying stable, in ways a per-test fixture can't undo. Rather than skip or
weaken those tests, they are pinned to run strictly last so nothing scheduled afterward can
observe the mutation — this preserves full parallelism for the rest of the suite instead of
serializing everything.

# Test ids (substring match against nodeid) that must run after everything else. Currently:
# TestRestartEquivalentRebootstrap calls importlib.reload(src.infrastructure.app_bootstrap),
# which replaces that module's top-level function objects (e.g. runtime_catalogs_dependency,
# module_registry_dependency) in place. Router modules already imported at collection time
# hold FastAPI `Depends(...)` bound to the pre-reload objects, so any other test on the same
# xdist worker that re-imports app_bootstrap fresh (to build `dependency_overrides`) after
# this one has run would get a *different* object identity than the router's — the override
# then silently misses and the real (uninstalled-registry) dependency runs instead. Pytest's
# default `--dist=load` xdist scheduler dispatches collected items in collection order to
# whichever worker next asks for work, so a test placed last in the full collected list is
# guaranteed to be the last test executed in the entire session, on any worker — no other
# test can run afterward to observe the mutation.
